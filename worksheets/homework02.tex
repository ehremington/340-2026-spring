\item 
Express the wave function for one-dimensional harmonic waves in terms of the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Frequency and wavelength
	\item Period and wavelength
	\item Angular frequency and wave vector
\end{itemize}

\item Consider the plane electromagnetic wave in vacuum (in SI units)
given by the expressions: $E_x = 0$, $E_y = 4 \cos [2p * 10^{14} (t - x/c) + p/2]$, and $E_z = 0$
\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculate the frequency, wavelength, direction of motion, amplitude, initial phase angle, and polarization of the wave.
	\item Write an expression for the magnetic flux density.
\end{itemize}

\item Write an expression for the $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields that constitute a plane
harmonic wave traveling in the $+z$-direction. The wave is linearly polarized with its plane of vibration at 45° to the $yz$-plane.

\item A 500-nm harmonic EM wave, whose electric field is in the z-direction, is traveling in the y-direction in vacuum. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the frequency of the wave?
	\item Determine both v and k for this wave.
	\item If the electric field amplitude is 700 V/m, what is the amplitude of the magnetic field?
	\item Write an expression for both $E(t)$ and $B(t)$ given that each is zero at $x = 0$ and $t = 0$. Put in all the appropriate units.
\end{itemize}

\item 
Consider a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave trav-
elling in the + x-direction in free space having as its plane of vibration
the xy-plane. Given that its frequency is 5 MHz and its amplitude is
E0 = 0.05 V>m,
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the period and wavelength of the wave.
	\item Write an expression for $E(t)$ and $B(t)$.
	\item Find the flux density, $<S>$, of the wave.
\end{itemize}
