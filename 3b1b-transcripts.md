# Video 1 : This tests your understanding of light | The barber pole effect

The setup here starts with a cylinder full of sugar water, basically, and we're about to shine some white light into it, but before it gets there, it passes through a linearly polarizing filter. And what that means, basically, is that if you look at all of the light waves beyond the point of that filter, those waves are only going to be wiggling in one direction, say up and down. And don't worry, in a few minutes we're going to go into much more detail about what specifically is wiggling and what the significance of that wiggling direction is, but skipping to the punchline first, the demo also includes a second linearly polarizing filter coming out the other end, and I want you to predict what we're going to see once we turn the light on. Now I suspect some viewers might already have a little bit of a sense for what's going on, because a few years ago Steve Mould made a really excellent video about this phenomenon of shining polarized light through sugar water. It was really well done, which is no surprise because everything Steve makes is, but even if you watched that, this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's still more to be explained. In fact, even if you made that video, this is a rich enough phenomenon that there's more to be explained. I'm curious, Steve, when you made that video, did you happen to get a good view of the side of the glass, probably when the rest of the lights in the room were off or something like that? No. No, I didn't think about the side view. Great. So given the setup that we're looking at now, once we turn off the room lights and turn on the lamp, I'm curious if you have a prediction for what you might see. Well, there will be some scattering, I suppose, but then if we're just looking at the tube, we're not applying any kind of filter to just looking directly at the tube. So, I mean, my instinct is nothing will happen. That would have been my guess too, but let me just show you what it looks like when we turn off the room lights and we turn on the lamp. Ooh. And then if you turn the initial polarizer, you can kind of see those. Wow. Stripes, those diagonal stripes seem to walk up the tube. Oh, wow. But why diagonal? Exactly, why diagonal? But why anything? I mean, why anything? Something about the interaction with sugar water separates the light out into these different bands of color, but it does so in this really intriguing way, where the colors appear to form these spiral helixes down the tube. And the other thing I want to draw your attention to is the color that's coming out of the tube after it passes through that second filter. As we rotate the first filter, you rotate through a family of distinct hues. And it doesn't have to be the first filter if you rotate that second filter, you also rotate through these various different colors. That's Quinn, by the way, who kindly set up this whole demo. And what I love about this setup is that if you want to really understand what you're looking at with that deep to your bones satisfying sense of what's going on, it requires having very solid intuitions for a number of different fundamental concepts about light, like polarization, how scattering works, and how an index of refraction works. To kick things off, let me show you the overall structure for the explanation of what's going on here, and along the way record various questions that we still need to answer. A basic premise to the whole thing is to think about polarized light as a propagating wave which is wiggling in just one direction. And I suppose question number zero is for us to be clear about what exactly is wiggling. Postponing that for the moment, we'll just say if we think about it as propagating in one direction, say along an x-axis, the wiggling happens perpendicular to that, say in the z-direction. What's going on when it passes through this tube of sugar water is that that wiggling direction gets twisted. And so the first key question is why? What is it about interaction with sugar that causes this twist? And just so that it's crystal clear what I mean by twisting, if you focus your attention on a single slice perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and draw a line indicating how the light is wiggling on that slice, then if you were to move that slice down the cylinder, the relevant wiggling direction slowly turns about the axis of the cylinder. Critically, the rate at which it's getting twisted depends on the frequency of the light. Higher frequency light, say violet, actually gets twisted more quickly than low frequency light, like red. So the second key question we need to answer is why would that twisting rate depend on the frequency? Whatever explanation we come to for why the twisting happens in the first place, it should offer some intuition for where the dependence on frequency would come from. Let's take a moment to think about what it means that different colors of light are getting twisted at different rates. In the demo we're shining in white light, and white light is not a clean pure sine wave, it's something more complicated. And you typically think about it as a combination of many different pure sine waves, each one corresponding to one of the colors in the rainbow. For this animation I will schematically represent the wiggling direction for each pure frequency, just with a line. So the key idea is that as all of those different waves propagate down the tube, with different pure frequencies twisting at different rates, purple light twisting the fastest and red light twisting the slowest, then the polarization directions for each one of those pure colors get separated out. For example, by the time you reach the end of the tube, they all have their own distinct wiggling directions. But one thing that's important to understand is that this is still white light. If you were to put your eye at the end of the tube and look towards the lamp, it wouldn't look colored in any way, because even if the wiggling directions are all different, they're still the same amount of each color as there was at the start. In order to see any evidence of this separation, one thing you could do is pass it all through a second linear polarizing filter, say in the vertical direction. The effect that has is that the amount of light of a given frequency passing through is equal to the component of its polarization direction that lines up with the filter. So colors which happen to align very closely with that filter pass through almost completely, whereas colors which end up more perpendicular to the filter pass through only very weakly. So the light coming out the other end of this filter is some imbalanced combination of all of the pure frequencies, which is why what we see coming out the other end is no longer white, but some other color. And notice if we rotate the whole setup, say by twisting the initial polarizing filter, then that changes the components of each pure frequency that happen to be vertical, resulting in a different balance of all those colors, which is why rotating the initial filter changes the color you see coming out the other end. And this is something you can do at home, by the way. You don't need a very fancy setup. Start by creating a pretty dense mixture of sugar water, and then you'll need to get your hands on some polarizing filters so that you can pass light first through one of those filters, then through the sugar water, and then through a second filter. And if you look at this whole setup from the top, as you rotate one of those filters, you'll see different colors. But even if you understand this, the thing that really had me scratching my head when Quinn showed me this demo was why you would see diagonal stripes when you view the cylinder from the side. I mean, take a moment to think about this. At any point down the tube, even though all the colors have been rotated differently, again, the light at that point is still white. It's still an equal balance of all the different colors. If you were to stick your eye inside the tube and look towards the lamp, you would see white. So why would viewing it from the side change what you see? The way I've made this animation, I've just left a faint shadow representing the wiggling direction for each color along the way down the tube. But that's just a cartoon. It's a schematic representation. Why is it that the actual way that light interacts with the molecules within the tube would discriminate between the colors in any way? And why would the stripes be diagonal? Wouldn't you think the setup should be completely symmetric from top to bottom? So these are the main questions we need to answer. Why would sugar cause the light to twist? Why would the rate at which it twists depend on the frequency of the light? And why, even if you understand both those facts, would you be seeing different colors appear in these diagonal stripes? You can answer these questions if you have a handful of key intuitions about optics. The first question requires understanding circularly polarized light, since the key is that sucrose is a chiral molecule, which is to say there's a handedness to it, it's different from its mirror image, and the slightly different effects that it has on right-handed versus left-handed circularly polarized light ends up explaining the twist. The second question requires understanding why light appears to slow down when it passes through a material. A sufficiently mathematical understanding for where that slowdown comes from ultimately explains the color separation here. And the third question comes down to the fact that when light scatters off of a material, it's not like some projectile bouncing in any old direction. The direction of scattering depends on the direction of polarization, and there's a very good reason for it. My aim is for all of these answers to feel less like facts that I'm handing down from on high, and more like inevitable discoveries emerging from a fundamental understanding for what light actually is. For that, we'll begin by returning to that question number zero, what exactly is wiggling? Which is to say, what is light? If you're curious about how the full explanation unfolds, come join me in the next video.

# Video 2: How wiggling charges give rise to light

In the last video, you and I looked at this demo here, where we shine linearly polarized light through a tube full of sugar water, and we saw how it rather mysteriously results in these colored diagonal stripes. There, I walked through the general outline for an explanation, keeping track of what questions still need to be answered. Namely, why does sugar water twist the polarization direction of light? Why does that twisting rate depend on the color of the light? And why, even if you understand that this twist is happening, would you see any evidence of it when viewing the tube from the side, with no additional polarizing filters? Here, I'd like to begin with the very fundamental idea of what light is, and show how the answer to these questions can emerge from an extremely minimal set of assumptions. In some sense, the fundamental question of electricity and magnetism is how the position and motion of one charged particle influences that of another. For example, one of the first things you learn, say in a high school physics class, is that charges with the same sign tend to repel each other. And the strength of this force depends a lot on the distance between them. If your charges are close, that repulsive force is very strong, but it decays very rapidly as these particles go away from each other. Specifically, here's how you might see this written down as an equation, known as Coulomb's law. The force is proportional to the charge of both of the particles, where it's common to use the letter q. There are some constants in there, which for our purposes we can just think of as one big proportionality constant. And the important fact is that you've got this 1 divided by r squared term, where r is the distance between them. So for example, if the distance between them increases by a factor of 3, the force that they're applying to each other goes down by a factor of 9. Another way you might see a law like this written down is to focus on just one charged particle, and then say for every point in space, if there was a second charge there, what force would this first charge be applying to that second one? And instead of describing a force per se, you might see this written describing what's known as the electric field, which is just a way of saying what force would be applied to a unit charge. And in this context, the word field means there's a value associated with every single point in space. So the way I have it written here, it depends on a little vector r, which would be the vector from our charge to a given point in space, and the direction of this field at all points is in the same direction as r. I bring up Coulomb's law to emphasize that it's not the full story. There are other ways that charges influence each other. For example, here's a phenomenon that this law alone could not explain. If you wiggle one charge up and down, then after a little bit of a delay, a second charge some distance to its right will be induced to wiggle up and down as well. We can write down a second law, which you might think of as a correction term to be added to Coulomb's law, that describes what's going on here. Suppose at some point in time t0, that first charge is accelerating. Then I'll let time play forward, but leave on the screen a kind of ghost of that particle indicating where it was and how it was accelerating at this time t0. After a certain delay, this causes a force on the second charge, and the equation describing this force looks something like this. So again, it's proportional to the charge of both of the particles, and once more a common way to write it involves this pile of constants that you don't really need to worry about. The important factor I want you to notice is how the force also depends on the distance between the particles, but instead of decaying in proportion to r squared, it only decays in proportion to r. So over long distances, this is the force that dominates, and Coulomb's law is negligible. And then finally, it depends on the acceleration of that first particle, but it's not the acceleration of that particle at the current time, it's whatever that acceleration was at some time in the past. How far in the past depends on the distance between the particles and the speed of light, denoted with c. The way to think about it is that any form of influence can't propagate any faster than this speed, c. In fact, a more accurate description of Coulomb's law would also involve a delay term like this. Again, the intuitive way to read this equation is that wiggling a charge in one location after some delay causes a wiggle to a second charge in another location. And actually, the way I have it written right now is a little bit wrong. Instead of the acceleration vector here, I should really be writing something like a perp, indicating the component of that acceleration vector which is perpendicular to the line drawn between the two charges. In other words, when you wiggle that first charge, the direction that the second charge wiggles is always perpendicular to the line between them, and the amount that it wiggles gets weaker and weaker when that line between them is more lined up with the initial acceleration. As before, this is something you might see written down in a way that describes a component of the electric field caused by just one charge. Again, that means what force would be applied to a second charge at all possible different points in space. This component of the field is only ever non-zero when our first charge is moving somehow, when it has an acceleration vector on it. And because of this delay term, the effects on this field tend to radiate away from the charge. This is why I'm writing it down with the subscript rad. This is the component of the electric field that will radiate away from a given charge. For instance, when the charge is oscillating up and down, you get these propagating waves. And for many of the vector fields I'll be showing, the intensity of the field is illustrated with the opacity of each little vector. This radiating influence is light, or more generally, electromagnetic radiation, including things like radio waves and x-rays and all that good stuff. As a side note, you sometimes see this propagation described a very different way that puts the fields front and center, using what are known as Maxwell's equations. For our purposes, I want to focus just on this one law and show just how far it can take us when it comes to intuitions for light. For the animations I'm about to show, all I've really done is encoded in this one law, which tells us what should this component of the electric field be at every point in space, as determined by the history of accelerations of a particular charge. For example, if I set that charge oscillating up and down in the z direction, and illustrate this component of the electric field everywhere on the xy plane, you see these circular propagations of equal strength in all directions. It's a little easier to think about if we focus on just one axis, like the x-axis. And at first when I made this animation, I assumed that there was some kind of bug, because near the charge it just looks crooked and wrong. But when you think about it, this is actually what you should expect, because remember, each one of these vectors is supposed to be perpendicular to the line drawn between that point and where the charge was at some point in the past. At points that are far enough away from the charge, which is where this component of the field is what dominates anyway, the wiggling in the field is essentially parallel to the wiggling in the charge, which is why when we think about light waves, we're safe to think about the wiggling direction as being perpendicular to the propagation direction. Like I said, this propagation for just one charge is equally strong in all of the directions perpendicular to its wiggling, and really I should emphasize that the propagation does happen in all directions of three-dimensional space. It's maybe a little busy to try to illustrate the full three-dimensional vector field on screen like this, so it's clarifying if we just focus on, say, the xz plane. Notice how the waves here are strongest in the x direction, but it still does propagate in all other directions, it's just that that propagation gets weaker in directions that are more aligned with the original wiggling. At the extreme, the only place where there's no propagation is in the z axis. Because our law has this 1 divided by r in it, the strength of the wave caused by just one particle does decay as you go farther away, in proportion to 1 over r. But notice what happens if I take a whole row of charges, say oriented along the y axis, and I have them all start wiggling up and down in the z direction, and I illustrate the combined effects that all of them have on this component of the electric field. The effects of all these charges interfere deconstructively along the y direction, but they interfere constructively along the x direction. This is what it looks like for a beam of light to be concentrated along just one dimension. So if you were to focus on the field just along the x axis, instead of decaying in proportion to 1 over r, this combined effect decays much more gently. In the extreme, you can get something arbitrarily close to those pure sine wave propagations we were illustrating earlier, if at some distance away you have a large number of charges oscillating in sync with each other like this. One thing that's worth emphasizing when you see light illustrated with a sine wave like this, is that even though that wave is being drawn in two or three dimensions, it's only describing the electric field along a one-dimensional line, namely the base of all those vectors. It's just that to draw the vectors you have to venture off of that line. Great, so one of the last important things to highlight before we get back to the sugar water is polarization. In everything I've been showing, the driving charge is just oscillating along a single direction, like the z axis, and this causes linearly polarized light. But it doesn't have to happen like that. For example, if I set the charge rotating in a little circle along the yz plane, meaning its acceleration vector is also rotating in a little circle, notice what the field looks like. This is known, aptly enough, as circularly polarized light. Honestly, it's easiest to think about for just one point of the electric field. What it means for light to be circularly polarized is that at that point, the electric field vector is just rotating in a circle. People often find circular polarization a little confusing, and I suspect part of the reason for that is that it's hard to illustrate with a static diagram, but also it's a little confusing when you try to think about the full electric field. For example, here's what the field looks like on the xy plane when I set that little charge rotating in a circle. It's certainly very beautiful, I could look at this all day, but you can understand why it might feel a little confusing. The very last thing I'll mention is that while everything here is a classical description of light, the important points still hold up in quantum mechanics. You still have propagating waves, there's still polarization that can be either linear or circular. The main difference with quantum mechanics is that the energy in this wave doesn't scale up and down continuously, like you might expect, it comes in discrete little steps. I have another video that goes into more detail, but for our purposes, thinking about it classically is fine. Part of the reason I wanted to go through that is because, frankly, it's just very fun to animate and I like an excuse for a fundamental lesson. But now let's turn back to our demo and see how we can build up an intuition for some of our key questions, starting from this very basic premise that shaking a charge in one location causes a shake to another charge a little bit later. And let's start by actually skipping ahead to question number three, why do we see the diagonal stripes? To think about this, you need to imagine an observer to the side of the tube, and then for a particular pure color, say red, if the observer looks in the tube and sees that color, it's because light of that color has bounced off something at that point in the tube, and then propagated towards the eye of the observer. Sometimes when people talk about light bouncing off of things, the implied mental image is a projectile ricocheting off of some object, heading off in some random direction. But the better mental image to hold in your mind is that when the propagating light waves caused by some wiggling charge reach some second charge causing it to wiggle, that secondary wiggle results in its own propagation. And for the animation on screen, that propagation goes back to the first charge, which itself causes a propagation towards the second. And this is what it looks like in a very simplified situation for light to bounce back and forth between two charges. If you have some concentrated beam of polarized light interacting with some charge, causing it to wiggle up and down, then these resulting second-order propagations are most strong in the directions perpendicular to the direction of polarization. In some sense, you could think of light as bouncing off of that charge, but the important point is that it doesn't bounce in all directions equally. It's strongest perpendicular to the wiggle direction, but gets weaker in all of the other directions. So think about our setup, and for a particular frequency of light, how likely it is that an observer looking at a particular point in the tube will see that light. Again, the key phenomenon with sugar water, which we have yet to explain, is that the polarization direction is slowly getting twisted as it goes down the tube. So suppose the observer was looking at a point like this one, where the polarization direction happens to be straight up and down. Then the second-order propagations resulting from wiggling charges at that point are most strong along the plane where the observer is, so the amount of red that they see at that point would look stronger. By contrast, if they were looking at a different point in the tube like this one, where the wiggling direction is closer to being parallel to the line of sight, then the direction where the scattering is strongest is not at all aligned with the observer, and the amount of red they see is only going to be very weak. And looking at our actual physical setup, if we first pass the light through a filter showing only the red, we see exactly this effect in action. As you scan your eyes along the tube, the intensity of red that you see goes from being high to being low, where it's almost black, back to being high again. As an analogy, imagine there was a ribbon going down the tube, always aligned with the polarization direction for this color, then putting yourself in the shoes of the observer, when you look at points where the ribbon appears very thin, you're going to see very little red light, whereas if you scan your eyes over to points where the ribbon appears thicker, you're going to see more red light. One thing that's nice about this is that if we try it for various different colors, you can actually see how the twisting rates are different for each one of the colors. Notice with red light, the distance between where it appears brightest and where it appears darkest is relatively long, whereas if you look down the colors of the rainbow, distance between the brightest point and the darkest point gets lower and lower. So what you're seeing in effect is how red light twists slowly, whereas light waves with higher frequencies get twisted more aggressively. But still, you might wonder why the boundaries between light and dark points appear diagonal. Why is it that in addition to having variation as you scan your eyes from left to right, there's also variation as you scan your eyes from the top of the tube to the bottom? This has less to do with what's going on in the tube, and more to do with a matter of perspective. Take a moment to think about many different parallel beams of light ranging from the top of the tube to the bottom. At the beginning, all of these light waves are wiggling up and down, and as you pass through the tube, and the effects of the sugar water somehow twists these directions, because they're all passing through the same amount of sugar, they're getting twisted by the same amounts. So at all points, the polarization of these waves are parallel to each other. If you're the observer and you look at the topmost point here, its wiggling direction is essentially parallel to the line of sight, so the light scattering from that point is basically not going to reach your eyes at all. It should appear black. But if you scan your eyes down the tube, the angle between the line of sight and the wiggling direction changes, and so there will be at least some component of red light scattering towards the eye. So as you scan your eyes from top to bottom, the amount of a particular color you see might vary, say from dark to light. The full demo that has white light is basically a combination of all these pure color patterns that go from light to dark to light with diagonal boundaries between the intense points and the weak points, hence why you see diagonal boundaries between the colors inside the tube. And now at last let's turn to the heart of the matter and try to explain why interactions with sugar would make light twist like this in the first place. It's related to the idea that light seems to slow down as it passes through a given medium. For example, if you look at the crests of a light wave as it goes into water, the crests through the water are traveling about 1.33 times slower than the crests of that wave would travel in a vacuum. This number is what's called the index of refraction for water. In a bit, what I'd like to show is how this index of refraction can be explained by analyzing how the initial light wave shakes all the charges in the material and how the resulting second order propagations superimpose with that original light wave. For right now, I'll just say that the interactions with each layer of the material ends up having the effect of slightly shifting back the phase of the wave, and on the whole, this gives the overall appearance that that wave moves slower as it passes through the material. Skipping ahead to what's going on with sugar, the relevant property of sucrose here is that it's what's called a chiral molecule, meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image. You could never reorient it in space to become identical to its mirror image. It's like a left hand or a right hand. Or another much simpler example of a chiral shape is a spiral. If I take this right-handed spiral, then its mirror image is a left-handed spiral, and no matter how you try to rotate and reorient that first one, it'll never become identical to the second. What's going on then is that the presence of a chiral molecule in the water like this introduces an asymmetry when it comes to interactions with light, specifically circularly polarized light. It turns out that the amount this chiral molecule slows down, say, left-handed circularly polarized light is different from the amount that it slows down right-handed circularly polarized light. Effectively, there's not one index of refraction, but two. Now you might say that seems irrelevant to our setup, since we are very deliberately shining in linearly polarized light, there is no circularly polarized light. But actually there's a sense in which linearly polarized light is equal parts left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light. Here, focus your attention on just one vector in this wave, wiggling straight up and down, which is to say polarized in the z direction. Notice how it's possible to express this vector as a sum of two rotating vectors, one of them rotating at a constant rate counterclockwise, and the other one rotating clockwise. Adding them together tip to tail results in a vector oscillating on a line. In this case, it's a vertical line, but that direction can change based on the phase of the two vectors we're adding together. Here, let me throw up a couple labels to keep track of how much each one of those two vectors has rotated in total, and then every now and then I'm going to slow down that first vector a little bit, and I want you to notice what happens to their sum. Well, every time I slow it down, effectively knocking back its phase a little bit, it causes the linearly wiggling sum to wiggle in a slightly different direction. So if the circularly polarized light wave represented by that left vector gets slowed down a little bit every time it runs across a sugar molecule, or at least slowed down more than its oppositely rotating counterpart would, the effect on the sum is to slowly rotate the direction of linear polarization. And hence, as you look at slices further and further down the tube, the polarization direction does indeed get twisted the way we were describing earlier, representing how the composite effects with many many many different sugar molecules are slightly different for left-handed light than they are for right-handed light. As a nice way to test whether you understood everything up to this point, see if just by looking at the direction of the diagonal slices on our tube, you can deduce which kind of light the sugar is slowing down more, left-handed light or right-handed light. I'll call this a partial answer to our question number one, because it still leaves us wondering why there's an index of refraction in the first place, and how exactly it might depend on the polarization of the light, not just the material it's passing through. Also, like I said at the start, a robust enough intuition here should also answer for us why the strength of this effect would depend on the frequency of the light. At this point I think we've covered quite enough for one video, so I'll pull out a discussion covering the origins of the index of refraction to a separate video. Thank you.

# Video 3: But why would light "slow down"? | Visualizing Feynman's lecture on the refractive index

I realized recently that I didn't really understand how a prism works. The standard explanation, what you might hear in a high school physics class for example, goes something like this. When light enters a medium, like glass, it slows down, in the sense that if you look at the crests of the wave, in a vacuum those crests are traveling at c, the speed of light, but inside the glass those crests will be traveling a little bit slower. And the specific ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed inside a medium like this is called the index of refraction for that medium. The reason we use the word refraction instead of say the index of slowing is that if a beam of light enters this glass at an angle, then a consequence of this slowdown is that it bends a little bit, or using the lingo, it refracts. And the way my high school physics teacher always explained this was to imagine a tank going from some region where it can travel relatively quickly, like concrete, into something slower, like mud, where if it's coming in at an angle, then as one of its treads hits the slow region first, that tread will be going slower while the other one is faster, causing the whole tank to steer a little bit, until that second tread also enters the mud, then it continues straight, just traveling a little slower. We'll get back to the actual reason for bending in a bit, but at this point the high school physics students typically learn a law known as Snell's law, which specifies exactly how much things bend. If you draw a line perpendicular to the boundary between the glass and water, and consider the angle between that perpendicular line and the beam of light, then Snell's law tells us that the sine of this angle divided by the speed of the light is always a constant. So the slower the light, the lower that angle will be, and that lets you actually calculate how much things refract. What's going on with a prism, then, is that the specific amount that light slows down depends a little bit on its frequency. For example, blue light, which has a relatively high frequency, would get slowed down more aggressively than red light, which has a relatively low frequency. Now most of the light that you see is not a clean pure sine wave, in particular the white light coming from the sun is not a clean sine wave, it's something much messier, but it can be expressed as a sum of a bunch of clean sine waves, each one corresponding to a pure spectral color. So when you shine white light into a prism like this, all those different components get refracted by slightly different amounts, causing this iconic separation of the pure rainbow colors. So that is the standard explanation, and it's not wrong per se, it's just that all of the key components are handed down from on high. Why would light slow down like this? And what exactly do we mean by slowing down? And even if you understand that, why would the amount that it slows down have anything to do with the color of the light? Is that just a coincidence, or is it necessary? If you have a sufficiently high standard for explanations, you want both of these facts to feel discovered, rather than feeling like they were handed down. The first explanation I saw that started to give this feeling came from the Feynman lectures on the matter, and a lot of what I'd like to do with this video is simply animate a lot of the key points that he makes there. It involves really digging in to think about each individual wiggling charge in the material, and the propagating light waves caused by each one of those charges, and how all of them superimpose on top of each other. Which feels like it should be a complete mess, but it actually works out to be not only understandable, but satisfyingly explanatory. For example, it explains why it has to depend on color, and the key intuition there really comes down to what happens if you're bad at pushing a child on a swing. Bear with me, I promise that'll make sense later. Also, when I mentioned on Patreon the intention to cover this topic, a lot of people had a lot of questions about the index of refraction. For example, numerous people asked about how it's possible for this number to be lower than 1, which really does happen, despite that seeming to imply the impossibility of something traveling faster than the speed of light. There was also a question about birefringence, which is where a material can have two different indices of refraction, causing you to c-double when you look through it. And that actually ties in really nicely to putting in the final puzzle piece from the last two videos about the barber pole phenomenon. And a couple people also asked about why light slowing down would imply a bending like this, and I agree that deserves a better explanation than the tank analogy. I promise we'll get to all of these questions later, but it makes sense to first lay down some groundwork by spending the bulk of our time on the key question of why passing through a medium would change the speed of a light wave at all. And for this, I want you to think of your material, like glass, as being broken up into a bunch of distinct layers, all perpendicular to the direction the light is traveling. And we'll start by focusing our attention on the effect of just one of those layers on the light wave. The true effect would be miniscule, but if you'll let me exaggerate it for a moment, what it does is kick back the phase of the wave. And maybe it's worth a brief aside to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to wave terminology. If you go and graph the function sine of x, when you put some term in front of it, affecting how high that wave oscillates up and down, that's what we call the amplitude, when you put a term in front of x, this will affect how rapidly it oscillates. If this is meant to describe a wave over time, that term would be called the angular frequency, whereas if it's meant to describe a wave over space, that constant would be called the wave number. Then if you were to add some other constant inside that sine function, and notice how as you change what that constant is, it sort of slides the wave left and right, that term describes the phase of the wave. So when I say that our light wave hitting a layer of glass causes its phase to get kicked back, I mean if you take whatever function describes it before it hits the glass, then the function describing it after that looks almost the same, just with a little extra something added to the input of that sine function. Like I said, in reality that'll be a very small number, something proportional to the infinitesimal thickness of that layer, but I'll keep drawing it as something exaggerated and keep track of the value of that phase kick over here on the left. Let's say you go and add a bunch of other layers of the glass, each one also applying their own kickback to the phase of the wave. The question for you is what does that new wave look like? If the value of that phase kick applied by each layer is something really close to zero, then the wave is hardly affected at all. But the larger that phase kick, the more the wave kind of gets squished together among all those layers. Admittedly, right here it looks all kaleidoscopic and weird, but that's really just because I have a discrete set of layers, each applying an unrealistically large kick. Notice what happens if I smooth it out by doubling the density of layers, but having each one only apply half the phase kick. And then I do that again, I double the density of the layers, but have each one only apply half the phase kick. As I continue this over and over, approaching a situation where you have a continuum of glass, each layer applying just a tiny infinitesimal phase kick, what you end up with is identical to, indistinguishable from, a wave that's simply traveling slower, oscillating up and down with the same frequency, but with a wavelength that's been kind of scrunched up. This right here is the first key idea with the index of refraction. Instead of asking why does light slow down in glass, what we really need to ask is why does its interaction with a single layer of that glass cause a kickback to the phase of the wave? And then when we want to get quantitative and understand exactly how much the light slows down, which is critical for understanding why it depends on color, instead the real question is how strong is that phase kick? From here it's helpful to turn back to the fundamentals of what light even is. This is something we talked a lot about in the last video, but a little review never hurts so let me go over the essentials. As many of you know, light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, but here we'll just be drawing the electric field. The electric field associates each point in 3D space with a little 3-dimensional vector telling you what force would be applied to a hypothetical unit charge sitting at that point in space. The key thing going on with light is that if you have a charged particle and something causes it to wiggle up and down, that results in these propagating ripples in the electric field away from the charge, and that propagation is traveling at the speed c, the speed of light. Whenever those ripples happen to reach another charged particle, they cause it to wiggle up and down, albeit a little more weakly than the initial wiggle, and that in turn causes its own propagations. The way we described this in the last video was that if at some point in time a charge is accelerating, then after a little delay, which depends on this speed c, the existence of that acceleration induces a force on another charge. We went over the specific force law describing this, it's something that can be derived downstream of Maxwell's equations, but for our purposes here, the main thing to tuck away in your mind is that the amount of time it takes that initial acceleration to cause any kind of influence elsewhere travels at exactly the speed c. And really, you should think of c not so much as the speed of light per se, but as the speed of causality. It determines how fast any kind of influence travels, it's just that one of multiple consequences of that is that it's the speed of light. In particular, when you get a charge oscillating up and down in a nice clean sinusoidal motion, you can think of these rippling effects in the electric field as describing the force that would be applied to another charge sitting there as a result of that past acceleration. I will freely admit that I had a bit too much fun in that video just simulating how the electric field responds to accelerating charges, and that I'm kind of doing the same thing here, but there are two important facts for our pursuit of the index of refraction. The first is that when you have multiple different charges oscillating up and down, the net effect on the electric field is just the sum of what it would be for each individual charge, which is kind of what you would expect. And then the way that it shakes out is that if you have a row of charges oscillating in sync with each other, or for our purposes today, a plane of charges all wiggling up and down in sync within that plane, then the effects of each individual charge tend to cancel each other out in most directions, except perpendicular to that plane, they actually constructively interfere. This is how you can get a concentrated beam of light. That's the important thing. If you have a layer of charges wiggling up and down in sync with each other, then even far away from that layer, it produces this nice sinusoidal wave in the electric field that we're so fond of drawing to represent light. When I draw a light wave like this, it's really only depicting the electric field on a single one-dimensional line. A more full picture of light in three dimensions would look something more like this. That tends to be a little bit busier, so usually we just draw the sine wave. So thinking back to the question of why interactions with a layer of material would cause a kickback to the phase of the wave, let's start thinking it through. When a light beam enters a material, like glass, then it causes all of the charges inside that material, you know, electrons or maybe the occasional ion, to wiggle up and down in response to that light wave. You might think that adding together all the propagations from all those charges is a complete nightmare, but we can think about it one layer at a time. As the light wave causes this layer to wiggle up and down, that wiggling produces its own second-order light wave at the same frequency. And it propagates in both directions perpendicular to that layer. The overall electric field, then, looks like the initial incoming light wave added together with the second-order wave. By far the most distracting part of what's going on here is everything on the left, and this actually corresponds to the light being reflected back. And from experience, you all know that when you look at water or you look at glass, light not only goes through it, but some of it gets reflected back. And we could have a whole interesting discussion on quantifying exactly how much, but in the spirit of staying focused, we will completely ignore that for today and only focus on what's happening to the right of that layer. You can probably predict what I'm going to say. It turns out that when you add that second-order oscillation, the overall effect is almost identical to the incoming light, but just shifted back in phase by a little bit. And then because many successive shifts to the phase like this are the same thing as light slowing down, this will ultimately explain the index of refraction. But of course the sufficiently curious viewers will now be raising their hands and asking, why is that the effect when you add them together? And so here it might be worth a little sidebar on how to think about adding two waves together. If you draw some sine wave with some particular amplitude, some specific frequency, and some specific phase, and then you draw another sine wave, also with its own amplitude, frequency, and phase, in general it's very hard to think about what the sum of those two waves should look like as you tweak those initial parameters. In the specific case where the frequencies are the same, which is true for our example, the result will also look like a sine wave with that same frequency. But even then it's a little tricky to think about exactly how to describe that wave. It has some amplitude and some phase, and if I ask you to concretely compute both of those numbers based on the amplitudes and phases of the initial waves, it's not immediately clear how you would do that without throwing a bunch of trig identities at the problem. But here's a really nice way to think about it. Imagine that first wave describes the y component of some rotating vector. The length of that vector corresponds with the amplitude of our wave, and then the initial rotation of that vector corresponds with the phase of our wave. Similarly, think of that second wave as describing the y component of another rotating vector, where again the amplitude corresponds with the length of that vector, and the phase of the wave tells us the initial angle of that vector. Now to think about the sum of the two waves, just think about adding those two vectors tip to tail. And because they both have the same frequency as both of them rotate, their sum rotates in lockstep with them. So if you want to think about the amplitude of our resulting wave, it comes down to the length of this vector sum, and similarly the phase corresponds to the angle of that vector sum. In some cases this tells you things that you probably already knew, like if the two phases happen to be the same, then you get constructive interference and you have a bigger wave that results. And if the phases were 180 degrees out of sync, then you get deconstructive interference with a relatively small resulting wave. What's a little bit less obvious, but what's crucial for our discussion here, is that if the phase of that second wave happens to be exactly 90 degrees behind the phase of the first, so kind of a quarter cycle out of sync, and if that second wave is also very small compared to the first, then if you look at the little vector sum on the lower left, you'll notice how this means that the resulting wave is almost identical to the initial wave, but just shifted back in its phase by a tiny bit. Moreover, the size of that phase shift depends on the specific amplitude of that second wave. So looking back at our previous animation, where we have some wiggling charges in a layer of glass causing these second order propagations that need to be added together with the incoming light, the way it works out is that the phase of that second wave is exactly a quarter of a cycle behind the phase of the first. So when you add them together, you get this little phase shift. And then, critically, the size of that phase shift is bigger when that second order wave is larger, and then smaller when that second order wave is smaller. Again, the very curious viewers will be raising their hands and saying, why does it work out to be exactly a quarter of a cycle behind? There is a very nice reason, but it's just a little too much detail for us today. If you're curious, I highly encourage you to take a look at the Feynman lectures on the matter. For our purposes, step back for a second and think about what you need to explain the key question of prisms, which is why the index of refraction would depend on color at all. As you now know, that index depends on how much each layer of glass kicks back the phase of the wave, and that phase kick depends on the strength of the second order wave resulting from charge oscillations in a layer of that glass. So you need to drill in and understand exactly how much those charges wiggle in response to an incoming light wave. So let's zoom in on that layer and think of each one of those charged particles, and even though the specific molecular structure is going to be something very complicated, we're going to model each one of those charges as if it was bound to some equilibrium position by a spring, or maybe a set of springs. I don't mean this literally, of course, I just mean if we describe the displacement of this charge from its equilibrium with a little vector x that's going to depend on time, then in our model, the force applied to the charge, pulling it back to that equilibrium, is going to be something proportional to the size of that displacement, with a little proportionality constant k. This is the same law that governs how springs work. You might ask if that's accurate, and the idea is that for very small displacements, it's actually a really good approximation. This is a very common thing to do throughout physics, we would call it a linear restoring force. The idea is that maybe the actual force law depends on the position in a much more complicated way, but we're basically taking a low order approximation near the equilibrium. If I just run this as a simulation, plugging in this force law, here's what that displacement looks like as a function of time. What you get looks like a sine wave, this is called simple harmonic motion, and the frequency of this wave is going to matter a lot for you and me, and finding that comes down to solving a certain differential equation, because the force is really the same thing as mass times acceleration, and the acceleration is the same thing as the second derivative of that displacement. So what we're saying is we want some function whose second derivative looks like a certain constant times that function itself. Any differential equation students among you might enjoy thinking about how you solve this. I won't go over the full details, but the answer is reasonably intuitive, and anyone who knows a little calculus can just check it for themselves. The way it shakes out is that if the initial condition is that our little charge has a velocity of zero, but it's offset from the equilibrium by a little vector x-naught, then the way it evolves over time looks like x-naught multiplied by a cosine expression. So the amplitude of this wave is kind of uninteresting, it just depends on how far we pulled things back originally, but the meet is this frequency term, square root of k divided by m. And if you think about it, this should hopefully be at least a little intuitive. For example, if you increase k, which is kind of like increasing the strength of that spring, then it results in a faster oscillation. Whereas if you increase m, the mass of the particle, there's a lot more inertia and it results in a slower oscillation. This term, square root of k divided by m, has a special name, it's called the resonant frequency for our simple harmonic oscillator. And being a little more precise, I should call this the resonant angular frequency. This is always a little bit of an awkwardness with physics, where whenever you have some kind of cyclic process, when you give an intuitive description, it's natural to phrase things in terms of the frequency, the number of cycles that this process makes per unit time. But when doing math, it's often more natural to talk about the angular frequency, which you could think of as describing how much angle this process covers in radians per unit time. It's just the same as the frequency, but multiplied by 2 pi. So for example, if you have something like a cosine expression, which you might think of as describing the x component of a cycling vector like this, then the term sitting right in front of the t in that cosine is the angular frequency. This is why angular frequency makes the math a little cleaner. For example, in our simple harmonic motion, the term sitting in front of t looks like the square root of k divided by m, which I'm writing as omega sub r. Let's package all of that up and call that our solution in the simple case where there's no external force acting on our charged particle. But of course, what we're interested in is what happens when you shine a beam of light on this material, which intuitively causes this charge to jiggle, but the question is how much. In our equation, this looks like adding a new force term corresponding to the light wave. That force oscillates up and down, also according to some kind of cosine function, but this time with a distinct angular frequency that I'm going to call omega sub l. E naught here describes the strength of the wave, and then q describes the charge of whatever particle we're modeling. As usual, it's a lot easier to think about when we only draw a subset of that light wave, and in this case we're going to draw it on the plane of the layer of material we care about. You might think of gusts of wind blowing our little ball on the spring up and down in a clean sinusoidal pattern. Or as another analogy, it's similar to pushing a child on a swing. The swing would oscillate on its own due to the force of gravity, but you as the pusher are applying an external force which itself is oscillating over time. Although a key difference here is that the frequency of that external force in general has nothing to do with the resonant frequency of that little oscillator. The better analogy would be if you're pushing the child on the swing with a cyclic force that has nothing to do with what the swing naturally wants to do. And my favorite part in literally trying to do this with my niece is that at some point she gently murmurs to herself, this isn't how mom does it. Now, in trying to understand how much our charge is oscillating in response to the incoming light, let me start by just simulating it and plotting the result. You'll notice that there's a little startup period where it kind of has to get going, but then after that, mercifully, it looks nice and clean, just like another sine wave. Now you might be thinking, yeah yeah, everything is sine waves, but it's important to understand that this one has a very different character from the sine wave we saw earlier. Earlier, without any external forces, the frequency of that wave came down to the spring constant and the mass, which is to say, it depends exclusively on material properties of the glass. By contrast, with this external cycling driving force, the frequency in that steady state is the same as the frequency of the light. In our first case, the amplitude of the wave was kind of uninteresting, it just depends on how far you pulled the spring out to begin with. But in the second case, the amplitude of this wave is actually where all the interesting stuff happens. Exactly how much will this charge be oscillating in response to the light wave? Again, I won't go over the full details of solving this, but any eager calculus students among you might enjoy going through the exercise where if you just guess that a solution looks like a cosine wave with the same frequency as the light, and you solve for the amplitude, you can get a concrete solution to this equation that looks like this. This is worth unpacking for a bit, and just to be clear, this is only describing things in the steady state, after things have gotten up and going. A fully descriptive solution would be notably more complicated. As I said, everything interesting here comes down to the amplitude, which here looks like a large collection of constants, most of which should be pretty intuitive if you take a moment to think about it. For example, it is proportional to the strength of that incoming light wave, so the stronger the light the more the oscillations. It's also proportional to the charge, which again makes sense. And the real heart of the matter comes down to what's sitting in the denominator here, the difference between the square of the resonant frequency and the square of the light frequency. And to build a little intuition, take a moment to think about what would happen if the frequency of the incoming light was something very close to the resonant frequency of this oscillator. This is analogous to the normal situation pushing a child on a swing, where the frequency of your force lines up quite closely with what the swing wants to do. In this case, running the simulation, notice how the oscillations of that particle will grow and grow and grow, becoming quite large over time. Some of you may know the famous example of the Millennium Bridge in London, where on its opening day it started oscillating way more than the engineers expected it to. And what was going on is that the frequency of the steps of the crowd lined up very closely with a resonant frequency, causing this worryingly high amplitude. By contrast, notice what happens in the simulation if the frequency of the light, ωL, is something much smaller than the resonant frequency. For this particular simulation it takes a little bit of a moment before things get into their full swing, eventually it finds a nice sinusoidal motion, but the amplitude of that motion is much more modest in comparison. So what our equation is telling us is that the larger the difference between those frequencies, then the bigger the denominator, so the smaller the overall wiggle to that charge. And again, this is something you can see in the footage with my niece. As I'm applying a force with a frequency that's very different from what the swing wants to she ends up oscillating at the same frequency as my force, but she's going at a relatively low amplitude. Stepping back, what this means is that as you shine light into a material like glass, it's not just that it induces wiggles in the charges of that material, but the specific size of those wiggles depends on the frequency of the light as a consequence of this denominator term. And the more those wiggle, the bigger the size of this second order wave caused by that layer, which in turn causes a bigger shift to the phase of the overall wave. Because a lot of different shifts to the phase are what causes this apparent slowdown to the light, it means that the amount that it will slow down ultimately depends on the frequency of the light. So that is the real reason why prisms work. You cannot truly explain the light separation until you get down to the driven harmonic oscillator. Now, I have left out a number of details, and again, I encourage the curious viewers to take a look at the Feynman lectures that a lot of this is based on. One quite important detail that would be a little criminal not to mention is that when we're modeling our charge as a little harmonic oscillator with this linear restoring force, there should really also be a term that depends on the velocity of that charge. You might think of this as a kind of drag force. This term accounts for the fact that energy from the incoming light wave is absorbed by the material. Without it, this whole explanation would seem to imply that light always passes through every material, not just glass and water, when as you can tell just by looking around, there's all sorts of materials for which light is mostly reflected and absorbed. As I mentioned at the start, folks on Patreon had numerous questions about the index of refraction, like how it can be less than one, and why slowing implies bending, so I made a supplemental video answering a handful of those questions, which should be published in just a few days. In the meantime, my friend Mithena from the channel Looking Glass Universe just put out a pair of videos on the related but definitely distinct question of whether light slows down in a medium, not in the sense of following the crests of a clean, pure sine wave in a steady state, but in the sense of trying to send information through that medium, like with a little wave packet. I definitely owe the existence of this video to many conversations with her about this topic, and viewers here will definitely enjoy taking a look, especially at the second one. By the way, some collaborators and I made this notebook that I think a lot of viewers might enjoy, and given that it's the holiday season it seems worth a quick mention. The premise is that every one of the pages has a quote that's related to math, and I had a lot of fun curating them all, trying to constrain myself to quotes conveying some genuinely thought-provoking idea. And then aside from the content, I basically made the kind of notebook that I most enjoy taking notes in, something that's readily portable with very faint gridlines helpful for diagrams, but otherwise unobtrusive, all bound in this nice soft faux leather. If that seems up your alley, you can find them in the 3blue1brown store next to a lot of other mathematical merchandise.

# Video 4: Answering viewer questions about refraction

The last video I put out was about the index of refraction. It talked about why light slows down when it passes through a medium, and in particular, why the rate of slowdown would depend on color. It turns out people have a lot of questions about the index of refraction, and in this supplemental video I wanted to take a chance to answer a couple of them. For example, how is it possible for this index to be lower than one, which seems to imply that light would travel faster than the speed of light through some materials. To kick things off though, I want to take a question that does not require too much background, asked by Kevin O'Toole, which is why exactly light slowing down would imply that it bends as it enters a medium. There's a common analogy, which is to think of something like a car or a tank, where it turns a little bit while one side of it slows down before the other, and although it's a very visceral and memorable analogy, it's not like light has wheels, and it also tells you nothing about how to be more quantitative and derive the formula describing exactly how much light bends. Here's a better way to think about it. If you have some light wave shining into a material like glass, if it slows down, notice how that means that it gets kind of scrunched up. If its wavelength in a vacuum was some number lambda, then the wavelength inside this material, where it's gotten slowed down, is something smaller than that. Here I am drawing the wave only on a one-dimensional line, but we need to understand it in at least two dimensions, where every point on this plane, for example, is associated with a little vector in the electric field oscillating up and down. This particular animation is a little bit messy and hard to follow, so it might be clearer if instead we simply color every point of the plane, such that those points are white near the crests of the wave, and then black away from the crests. You can still clearly see the wavelength as the distance between these crests. It's exactly what we were looking at before, just drawn in a different way, and in particular notice how they're scrunched up inside the glass. If that glass were positioned at an angle, think about what happens to each one of those wave crests. As it hits the glass, the lower parts slow down before the top parts, causing it to get sort of smeared out. It reminds me a little of the rolling shutter effect, and overall the wave crest ends up at a different angle. When you take into account the fact that for a beam of light, the beam is always perpendicular to those wave crests, this means your light has to turn, and moreover you can calculate exactly how much it needs to turn. Think about all those waves in the vacuum, with some kind of wavelength lambda-1 sitting between them, and focus on all the points where those crests intersect with the boundary between the vacuum and the glass. But then consider those wave crests inside the glass. If it was the case that no bending happened, then because the wavelength is smaller in there, when you look at all those intersection points, they would have to be closer together. But of course that can't happen, whether you're looking at it from one side, or looking at it from the other, those intersection points are all the same. So the only way this can work is if those wave crests inside the glass were oriented at a different angle. You might mentally imagine turning them with a little knob to find the sweet spot angle where all those intersection points line up. And for those of you into exercises, you could take a moment to try to write down the specific equation telling you how to relate the wavelengths inside and outside the glass with the angles between those wave crests and the boundary itself. If you do this, what you write down is effectively the same thing as Snell's law, you just have a tiny bit of added work to relate the relevant angles here, and then to note how the speed and the wavelength all depend on each other. To answer the other questions I want to get to, we're going to lean pretty heavily on the explanation from the main video. I'm mostly assuming that people here will have watched that, but here's a quick recap of the key points. When we talk about a light wave slowing down in a material, what's really going on is that its interaction with each layer of that material slightly kicks back the phase of the wave. Now a continuous sequence of infinitesimal phase kicks like this produces something that's mathematically identical to a wave that's just traveling slower. The actual mechanism for that phase kick is that the incoming light wave causes the charges in the material to oscillate a little bit. Those oscillations produce their own propagation in the electromagnetic field, and when you add together this newly induced wave with the original one, then in the region of space past that layer, the sum looks just like a copy of that original wave, but shifted back a little. The last key point is that if you want to know the size of that phase shift, which is what determines the index of refraction, we model the charges in the material as simple harmonic oscillators, bound to some equilibrium position with a linear restoring force. What we found is that the amplitude of oscillation, when you shine a light on a charge like this, will depend on how close the frequency of that light is to the resonant frequency associated with this spring-like restoring force. Or to put it shortly, the index of refraction depends on how much the light resonates with charges in the material. As an example of one phenomenon that this explanation helps us to understand, let's take a question asked by Dan Stock, which is what causes birefringence? So this is a phenomenon where a material has two distinct indices of refraction, which has the effect of making you see double when you look through it. Imagine you have some kind of crystal structure such that the ions in that structure will have some restoring force when you pull them in one direction, which is distinct from the restoring force when you pull them in another direction. That is, the resonant frequency for oscillations in one direction is distinct from the resonant frequency from oscillations in another. What that means is if you shine some light through this material, then because the index of refraction depends on resonance, the value of that index of refraction will be different for light that's oscillating up and down than it will for light that's oscillating side to side. That is, it depends on the polarization of the light. And this really happens. The example you're looking at right now is calcite, and when you're seeing double, it's because light with one polarization is getting bent at a different rate than light with the other polarization. For those of you who watched the videos about the barber pole effect, a very similar phenomenon answers the final question that we left there. If you didn't watch those, feel free to jump ahead, but if you did, you might recall that where we left off was with a claim that sugar causes right-handed circularly polarized light to travel at a slightly different speed from left-handed circularly polarized light. The reason that mattered is that it meant linearly polarized light, which can be expressed as a sum of those two, will slowly rotate over time as one of those two components lags behind the other. Once you understand that an index of refraction depends on resonance, you can start to see why something like this might happen. If the molecular structure of sucrose was one such that electrons might get pushed along a path with a clockwise component more freely than they get pushed along paths with counterclockwise components, well that would mean that the resonance with right-handed circularly polarized light would be a little different from what it is for left-handed circularly polarized light, and hence the indices of refraction would be slightly different for each one. When you combine this together with the fact that the resonance depends on the frequency of the light, which is to say it depends on the color, this ultimately explains why the optical rotation in that barber pole effect separated out the colors the way that it did. Now one example of a shape that would resonate differently with left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light would be a helix, and in fact people will use a helical antenna when they want to pick up on radio waves with just one-handedness. Although sucrose is not so clean and pure an example as a helix, the key property is that it is chiral, meaning it's fundamentally different from its mirror image, in that there's no way to reorient it in 3D space to make it look like its mirror image. I will not pretend to know why this particular structure resonates with one-handedness more than another, but at least in principle it makes sense that chirality would lend itself to this phenomenon. And finally, to wrap things up, let's hit what might be the most intriguing question of them all, which is how the index of refraction can be lower than one, since what that seems to imply is that the speed of light through a medium would be faster than the speed of light. So this really does happen, and it's not as wild as you might think. If you think back to how everything in our discussion arose from how a layer of material can kick back the phase of a wave, there is no reason that the layer of the material can't also kick forward the phase of that wave, and when you have many successive layers, kicking forward the phase like this, it gives the illusion of a wave that's traveling faster than the speed of light, in the sense that those crests genuinely are moving faster than c. In fact, when you unpack the math underlying all of this, whenever the key amplitude expression that we wrote down is smaller than zero, that corresponds to an index of refraction smaller than one. So in particular, if the frequency of the light, omega sub l, is bigger than the resonant frequency for our oscillator, you have this effect. For example, when you shine an x-ray through glass, the index of refraction really is smaller than one. There is no contradiction with causality here, and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the role played by the speed c in all of this explanation. c is the speed determining how long it takes for an accelerating charge to induce a force on any other charge. Even if there's material in the way, whether that material has an index of refraction bigger than one or less than one, that amount of time that it takes for the influence of one charge to reach another is always the distance between them divided by c. By contrast, the speed that's relevant to an index of refraction is how fast the crest of one of those waves is moving. This is known as the phase velocity. That phase velocity is what determines how much the wave gets scrunched up, which in turn determines how much it refracts or bends, which is part of the reason I think it's very good terminology to call this the index of refraction rather than say the index of slowing. In general, the electric field inside a medium like glass is this incredibly complicated sum of a whole bunch of propagating influences from every one of the wiggling charges in that material, all together with the incoming light wave. But importantly, all of those individual propagations are traveling at c, never slower, never faster. It is miraculous that the way that these combine can be described simply at all, and that it's not some monstrously intractable mess. But we are fortunate, and when you add them all up, the net effect can be described cleanly, and it looks just like a sine wave, one whose phase velocity happens to be different from c. Another thing to keep in mind if it seems very weird for these wave crests to move faster than c is that everything in this explanation depends very heavily on things being in a steady state. That's very different from say, trying to send information through the medium with a little pulse of light. This is what Mithana explores in her videos on the index of refraction over on Looking Glass Universe, which you should definitely look at. Over there she talks about how when you express a pulse of light as a sum of many pure sine waves, even if the phase velocities of those constituent components go faster than c, that doesn't necessarily imply that the center of mass of this pulse will itself go faster than c. And in fact, when you simulate the effect of passing through a medium, when the index of refraction is less than one, what you find is a pulse that goes slower than c, even when the crests within it are going faster. And if that still seems a bit weird, here's an analogy to help see why phase velocity can be way higher than the speed of anything real. Imagine a little machine that has a bunch of rotating arms all extending from a shared shaft. If you view this machine from the side, the tips of all of those arms form what looks like a wave, with crests traveling from right to left. But if I go and reposition the arms to be angled quite close to each other, then you can make it so that the phase velocity of this emergent wave is arbitrarily high, potentially faster than the speed of light or anything else, even when the shaft is rotating at a gentle constant rate, and even when every component of the machine is moving at a reasonably slow pace. Here, it's pretty obvious that such a machine doesn't violate the rules of physics, and that it doesn't let you send messages faster than light, because the wave crest is not a real object. It's not something that could carry information. It's more of an illusion. The phase velocity in a light wave is similar. Sure, if you shine an x-ray through glass, it is true that the wave crests go faster than the speed of light, but the underlying influences between electric charges that determine the field values in the first place are themselves all bound by the speed c.
